- Complexity is the enemy. Avoid complexity.
- Use simple, verbose code that is easy to understand and maintain, instead of dense, terse code.
- Use functional programming principles. Avoid object-oriented programming.
- Always update the README.md file.

**Important** 
Maintain a Progress.md file which highlights the conversation and progress history's key point
